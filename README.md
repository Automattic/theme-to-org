# Theme Tools

This repository houses a collection of scripts and micro-tools, designed to help theme builders build better themes. Ideally our collection of tools will grow as we find more processes that can be improved and automated.

In-depth READMEs for each tool can be found in that tool's directory.

What's here (so far):

- theme-to-org: A script that downloads a theme from WordPress.com and packages it up for submission to the WordPress.org theme directory.
